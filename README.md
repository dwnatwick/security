This is the start of a community project project to outline real world projects and scenarios for Dev and IT-Pros.

For this project to be successful, we want to have the community collaborate.

If you have a specific scenario to contribute or would like answered, open an issue on this repo.

If any community members following this repo have an option or an answer, comment on the issue.

Example issues have been created.

We will then take this information and create a tech blog to bring this all together.

Some rules: 

- Do not use specific customer names, keep it generic.
- Be kind and helpful. We are all here to help.
